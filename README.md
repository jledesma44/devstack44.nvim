# Devstack44 Neovim Configuration

This is my neovim configuration for 2025. This is a work in progress and will be further modified.
Things that I plan to modify:
1. keymaps 
2. plugins

The current keymaps that I have in my configuration come from someone else's configuraions and I will change some of these keymaps to my own prefernces.

There are a couple of plugins that I want to use in my configuration but I need to research a bit more before I install them.
